## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hey there! I’m **Christopher J. Roura**, but most people know me online as **elGordoRoura**. I’m a self-taught, passionate developer who thrives on creating and teaching. My coding journey started back in 2018 at the Apple Developer Academy in Naples, Italy, where I fell in love with building apps that make a difference.

Over the years, I’ve worn a lot of hats—iOS developer, IT support, mentor, and even instructor. When I’m not working on my apps or teaching the next generation of developers, I’m geeking out over cars, hanging out with my dog Nicky, or diving into some good tech podcasts. I love staying curious and sharing what I learn with others.
