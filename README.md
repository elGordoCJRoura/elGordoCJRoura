## 📜 My Versatility & Experiences

### Technical Skills and Experience  

#### Legacy Work  
I have worked extensively with UIKit. It was what I first learned in 2018 at the Apple Developer Academy, and I continued using it through my work at Favor. I learned about traditional MVC patterns with UIKit and have broadened my skillset to update UIKit code and adopt more modern approaches.

#### Programming Languages  
Aside from Swift, my first programming language was Java, and I have also dabbled in Python.

#### Cross-Platform Development  
All of my apps are cross-platform to some capacity. Task Swiftly, in particular, is designed for all major Apple platforms.

#### Tools and CI/CD  
I currently use Xcode Cloud to manage my CI/CD flows and have also worked in environments using GitHub Actions.

### Leadership and Mentorship  

#### Teaching & Mentorship  
I teach iOS development at Kodeco, mentoring developers at all levels. For junior developers, I focus on building their confidence and teaching them how to research solutions effectively. For example, I guided a junior developer struggling with creating models from JSON. I had them control the session, walked through the API documentation, and taught practical tips, ultimately letting them apply their learning independently.

#### Team Collaboration  
I have spearheaded cross-functional teams, such as leading a complete redesign of the address screens in the Favor delivery app. I collaborated with product, design, QA, and backend teams to align all moving components, ensuring a seamless delivery of consistent code.

#### Open Source Contributions  
I have not yet contributed to open-source projects but am currently working on a few that I plan to release publicly.

### Projects and Portfolio  

#### Freelance/Client Work  
As an indie developer, I have built my own apps from scratch, including RecipeKit, Luminae, Task Swiftly, and ChirpCast, showcasing my diverse skillset.

#### Non-iOS Apps  
I have developed apps for macOS, tvOS, and watchOS. Task Swiftly, in particular, is designed to run across all Apple platforms.

#### Hackathons & Competitions  
I have participated in several hackathons and enjoy the fast-paced, collaborative environment they offer.

### Soft Skills and Problem Solving  

#### Problem-Solving Examples  
I rebuilt the credit card scanning feature in Favor. Initially, it was supposed to be a simple package swap from card.io to Stripe, but Stripe’s framework didn’t align with our design. After consulting product and design, I built the feature in-house using Apple’s Vision framework, ensuring it met design specifications.

#### User-Centric Design  
I prioritize user feedback to understand expectations and experiences, incorporating improvements where applicable while balancing feature ideas and bug fixes.

#### Adaptability  
Teaching keeps me up-to-date with evolving technologies. I watch WWDC videos, research documentation, and build one-off projects to solidify my knowledge.

### Personal Branding and Outreach  

#### Content Creation  
I create app-related content and plan to release videos based on digestible chunks of code tied to app functionality.

#### Community Engagement  
While I’ve presented my capstone project, I haven’t spoken at conferences but am open to exploring this space.

#### Personal Branding  
Currently, I am working on creating a consistent personal brand and building my presence in the developer community.

### Diversity and Interests  

#### Hobbies/Interests  
I am passionate about technology, cars, rangers, and dogs. These interests often influence my development style and creative process.

#### Side Projects  
My smaller projects include one-off experimental apps, which I plan to release as open-source resources showcasing new APIs and features.

#### Volunteering  
I have not volunteered at tech-related events but would love to get involved in the future.
